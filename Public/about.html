<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Shon, your friendly neighborhood web developer. When Iâ€™m not busy battling code bugs or building cool projects, you can find me binge-watching sci-fi movies or trying to perfect the art of making the perfect cup of coffee â˜•.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about creating dynamic, interactive websites and occasionally pretending to be a wizard when my code actually works on the first try. âœ¨</p>

<p>Letâ€™s build something awesome together and have some fun along the way! ðŸ˜Ž</p>
